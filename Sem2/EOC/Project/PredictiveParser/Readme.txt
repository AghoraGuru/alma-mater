How to use the parser to parse a file??

Change second cell input values to change jack files.

The input should be the path of the jack file, if the file is in the same directory as the .py file, just use the file name with .jack extension.

Run cell 1 before cell 2 to see the output of the first cell.

.xml file will be in the same folder as the jack file.
