Dont change any code in SupportFiles.java because it contaoins all main functions used in Emulator such as getting usr input to converting decimal input to binary.
You need CPU.java for emulator to work cuz ofcourse u need a CPU file .

AutoHardware Simulator is not yet finished as on 13/02/2022 it may not be developed further as the purpose of this repo is over .
Use ManualHardSimu is funcitonal you just need to uncomment which chip you need to test !
